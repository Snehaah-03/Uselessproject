# Eyes ,Chico,Never Lies!🎯

### Project Description
What if technology could decode love… just by analyzing someone’s eyes?
Enter “Eyes, Chicos, Never Lie” — a completely unnecessary, slightly insane, and proudly useless web app that pretends to detect love in a girl’s eyes using image upload and random logic.

Built during a "Useless Hackathon," this project was inspired by Vineeth Sreenivasan movies, meme culture, and the never-ending overthinking of a 0.5-second eye contact.



### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
❌ The Problem That Doesn’t Exist
“Bro, she looked into my eyes. Do you think she’s in love with me?”

In the grand list of global problems — climate change, cancer, inflation — "not knowing if she's in love with you just by eye contact" isn’t even close.
And yet, it’s a crisis for thousands of emotionally unstable individuals every day.

We spend hours:

Replaying a 2-second stare

Zooming into blurry group photos

Asking friends: “Did you see the way she looked at me?”

But no app, no tool, no AI has ever dared to say:

“Yes bro, she loves you.”
or
“No bro, it’s just your imagination.”

So, we decided to fix this nonexistent problem…
Because overthinking eye contact deserves a solution too.



### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
✅ The Solution That Never Exist
Faced with the invisible crisis of eye-contact overanalysis, we built a solution the world never asked for:

🥸 Eyes, Chicos, Never Lie™
The only (and most useless) app that claims to detect love... just from her eyes.

💡 What does our fake-genius solution do?
📷 Upload a photo of her face.

👁️ OpenCV detects the eyes — the “windows to the soul.”

🎲 A random logic engine “analyzes” if love is present.

🎶 If love is detected: Romantic background music plays.

🤡 If not: You're hit with savage, meme-level rejection messages.

🗣️ A troll chatbot gives you the worst love advice ever.
